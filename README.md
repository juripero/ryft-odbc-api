# ryft-odbc-api

The RYFT ODBC API project contains sample sources to demonstrate the programmatic use of the ODBC 
and JDBC interfaces when connecting to a RYFT ODBC server installation. The project contains two samples, 
both of which implement an “SQL Console”, a CLI capable of performing queries against the RYFT ODBC 
server data source and displaying the result sets that are returned by the server.
